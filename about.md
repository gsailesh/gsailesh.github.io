Learning is a lifelong pursuit, no matter the profession. As a data scientist in a non-tech organization, the challenge isn’t just applying AI and ML but keeping pace with their relentless evolution. Cutting-edge innovations aren’t always part of the daily grind, nor do trending technologies reveal their intricacies with ease. The only way forward is to dive deep, explore, and uncover insights firsthand.

In 2025, I’m rekindling my curiosity—committing to a habit of thoughtful learning and meticulous note-taking. These notes will serve as a guide for my future self and a resource for anyone who happens to stumble upon this blog. The journey of discovery never truly ends, and I’m ready to embrace it once again.
