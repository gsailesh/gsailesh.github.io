An overview of the GPT model architecture showing the flow of data through the GPT model. Starting from the bottom, tokenized text is first converted into token embeddings, which are then augmented with positional embeddings. This combined information forms a tensor that passes through a series of transformer blocks shown in the center. Each transformer block contains multi-head attention and feed-forward neural network layers with dropout and layer normalization. These blocks are stacked on top of each other and repeated 12 times.

## Summary

- Layer normalization stabilizes training by ensuring that each layer's outputs have a consistent mean and variance.
- Shortcut connections are connections that skip one or more layers by feeding the output of one layer directly to a deeper layer, which helps mitigate the vanishing gradient problem when training deep neural networks, such as LLMs.
- Transformer blocks are a core structural component of GPT models, combining masked multi-head attention modules with fully connected feed forward networks that use the GELU activation function.
- GPT models are LLMs with many repeated transformer blocks that have millions to billions of parameters.
- GPT models come in various sizes, for example, 124, 345, 762, and 1,542 million parameters, which we can implement with the same GPTModel Python class.
- The text-generation capability of a GPT-like LLM involves decoding output tensors into human-readable text by sequentially predicting one token at a time based on a given input context.
- Without training, a GPT model generates incoherent text, which underscores the importance of model training for coherent text generation.
